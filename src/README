There are two sections in this folder

1. The mininet setup section:
Files include: run.sh  
               minitopo.py
               nathw.py

By setting parameters in run.sh, we can specify bottleneck bandwidth, queue length and other parameters.

Running run.sh triggers minitopo.py which starts a simple mininet topology (two virtual switches and several hosts),
and runs a dhcp server on a virtual dhcp host.

nathw.py is invoked by minitopo.py for setting up two real interfaces on the two virtual switches respectively,
and it also sets a rootnode for the mininet machine as 10.0.0.254 that is where I run statscollector



2. Stats collector section:
Files inclde statscollector.py 
	     agent.py
	     tcshow.py

statscollector.py file setups a RESTful API server, one can call it to get the stats by put the following addr in a URL:
http://<the server ip>:<the server port>/stats/<src_ip>/<dst_ip>/<earliest_idx>/<num_entries>
(Note: /stats/ is the function name and there is no need to modify it)

For example:
http://149.171.37.108:8080/stats/10.0.0.25/10.0.0.32/0/0

as discussed,if earliest_idx and num_entries are both set to 0, then show all entries.


agent.py is the main logic:
         At northbound, it calculates the bw and delay for required entries
         At southbound, it obtains required entries from tcshow
	 It also runs a timer so that when it is idle it goes to sleep

tcshow.py pulls stats by parsing regular expression of tc

###################################
I.Start mininet topology:
	To run it successfully, make sure mininet,OVS and pox are installed
	Also make sure sshd and dhcpd are available to use
	1.edit run.sh specify bottleneck speed in Mbps, Real Interfaces, and general bandwidth capacity hs_bw
	2.flush ip addresses e.g.ip addr flush eth0
	3.simply type sudo ./run.sh
	This will create the following topology:
                |-----------------------------|
                |   h1                  h2    |
                |   |                    |    |
                |   |                    |    |
        eth0----|---s1------------------s2----|------eth1
                |   |                         |
                |   dhcp                      |
                |_________________Linux Server|

Note:
	i)Any external connected devices with DHCP enabled, would be automatically assign an IP 10.0.0.X/24
	ii)You can also ssh to any virtual hosts h1,h2 or dhcp on the Linux Server
        iii)The Linux Server has a namespace 10.0.0.254 and this is the address for stats collector http request as well

II.Run stats collector
	Preparation:
	Make sure python bottle module, paste module are installed
	1.type net in mininet to see how interfaces are connected, 
          edit retVal = ["s1-eth2","s2"] for the path in find_path(a_ip,b_ip) 
	  also change the a_ip and b_ip conditions in that function based on your assigned ip
	2.if you did not use the default link speed settings, please change the max_bw[] list in agent.py file with reverse ordered link speed settings
	3.now you are good to run by simple type: sudo python statscollector.py

If there is any error pls report back to me: yu.wang1@unsw.edu.au
